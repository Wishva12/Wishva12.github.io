## Research Overview

**Status:** Ongoing Research Project

Investigating temporal and spatial patterns of epidemic diseases in Sri Lanka using advanced machine learning and time series forecasting techniques to support early warning systems for public health planning.

## Research Objectives

- Identify spatiotemporal patterns in epidemic disease outbreaks
- Develop predictive models for early warning systems
- Support evidence-based public health policy decisions
- Create actionable insights for disease prevention strategies

## Methodology

### Data Analysis Approach
- **Temporal Analysis** - Time series modeling to identify seasonal patterns and trends
- **Spatial Analysis** - Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for location-based insights
- **Machine Learning** - Predictive modeling for outbreak forecasting
- **Statistical Methods** - Advanced spatial statistics for pattern recognition

### Technologies & Tools

- **Data Processing:** Python, Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning
- **Geospatial Analysis:** GeoPandas for spatial data handling
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn for predictive modeling
- **Time Series:** Advanced forecasting techniques and trend analysis
- **Visualization:** GIS mapping and statistical visualizations
- **Statistics:** Spatial statistics and epidemiological modeling

## Research Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Gathering historical epidemic data from health authorities
   - Cleaning and standardizing multi-source datasets
   - Geographic coordinate mapping and validation

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Temporal pattern identification across different time scales
   - Spatial clustering analysis of outbreak locations
   - Correlation analysis between environmental and disease factors

3. **Model Development**
   - Time series forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet)
   - Spatial regression models for geographic patterns
   - Machine learning ensemble methods for prediction

4. **Validation & Testing**
   - Cross-validation with historical outbreak data
   - Model performance evaluation and comparison
   - Sensitivity analysis for different scenarios

## Expected Outcomes

- **Early Warning System** - Predictive models for potential outbreak identification
- **Risk Mapping** - Geographic risk assessment tools for health authorities
- **Policy Recommendations** - Data-driven insights for public health planning
- **Research Publications** - Academic contributions to epidemiological literature
